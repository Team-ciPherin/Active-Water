Active Water is an initiative for water sustainability. We all have water purifiers installed in our homes and common perception of all water purifier users is that the water drained out from the purifier is useless as it has high concentration of TDS in it.
We want to make this water use by diluting the concentration of TDS as per the required chores of the house.

Active Water uses TDS sensor and sends us data the amount of TDS present in the water. Then we can choose the required task we want to accomplish like washing a car or washing utensils or wateeing the plants. Our product will dilute the water with purified water as per the maximum TDS level we can use for that particular task.

Our product ensures we don't store water for too long.

We aim to save up atleast 80% percent of the water drained out from the purifier.
